        answer: "An AI video face swap tool uses artificial intelligence to replace a face in a video with a face from a source image. The AI analyzes the facial features, expressions, and movements in the target video and maps the new face onto it frame by frame, creating a seamless and realistic video."

        question: "Is this free video face swap tool safe to use?",

    },
    {
        question: "How do I get the most realistic face swap video?",
        answer: "For the best results, use a clear, high-quality photo of the source face looking directly at the camera. For the target video, choose one where the original face is also well-lit and clearly visible. The closer the angles and lighting match, the better the final result will be."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I swap my face onto a movie character?",
        answer: "Yes, you can! This is a popular and fun way to use the tool. Simply use a photo of yourself as the source image and a clip from a movie as the target video. It's a great way to create funny memes and content for social media."
    },
    {
        question: "Are there any watermarks on the downloaded video?",
        answer: "No, our AI face swap video generator is completely free and does not add any watermarks to your downloaded videos. You are free to use your creations for your personal and creative projects."
