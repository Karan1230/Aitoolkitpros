        question: "What is an AI cartoon avatar maker?",
        answer: "An AI cartoon avatar maker is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to transform your photo into a stylized avatar. You can choose from various artistic styles like 3D, Anime, or Comic Book, and the AI will reinterpret your picture in that style while preserving your key facial features."
    },
    {
        question: "Is this AI avatar generator free?",
        answer: "Yes, our cartoon avatar maker is completely free to use. You can upload your photo, generate avatars in different styles, and download your creations without any cost or subscription."
    },
    {
        question: "What kind of photo should I upload for the best results?",
        answer: "For the best results, upload a clear, well-lit, front-facing photo of yourself. Avoid pictures with sunglasses, heavy shadows, or obstructed faces. A clear headshot works best for the AI to capture your likeness accurately."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I create an avatar with a transparent background?",
        answer: "Absolutely! Our tool gives you the option to generate your avatar with a transparent background, which is perfect for use as a profile picture (PFP), in graphic designs, or on websites. You can also choose a solid color or a custom scene."
    },
    {
        question: "How is this different from a regular cartoon filter?",
        answer: "Unlike a simple filter that just overlays an effect, our AI avatar generator rebuilds your image from scratch in the chosen style. This results in a much more authentic and high-quality artistic interpretation, creating a true piece of digital art rather than just an edited photo."
