    {
        question: "What is an AI song generator?",
        answer: "An AI song generator is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to create original music from text prompts. You can describe the genre, mood, and even lyrics, and the AI will compose a full song with vocals and instrumental accompaniment."
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need to know how to sing or play an instrument?",
        answer: "Not at all! Our AI music generator is designed for everyone, including those with no musical experience. The AI handles all aspects of music creation, from composing the melody to generating the vocals, so you can be a songwriter without any technical skills."
    },
    {
        question: "Is the music generated by the AI song creator royalty-free?",
        answer: "Yes, the music you create with our tool is generally royalty-free for use in your personal and commercial projects, such as YouTube videos, podcasts, and social media content. We always recommend checking the specific terms for any usage to be safe."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I use the AI lyric generator to write lyrics for me?",
        answer: "While this specific tool focuses on generating the full song from a descriptive prompt, many AI models can assist with lyric writing. You can describe your song's theme in the prompt, and the AI will often generate fitting lyrics as part of the song creation process."
    },
    {
        question: "How does the AI song generator with vocals work?",
        answer: "Our tool uses advanced generative AI models trained on vast amounts of musical data. When you provide a prompt, the AI synthesizes a melody, harmonies, and a vocal track that matches the style and theme you described, creating a complete and cohesive piece of music."
