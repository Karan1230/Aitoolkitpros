    {
        question: "What is an AI image face swap tool?",
        answer: "An AI image face swap tool uses artificial intelligence to take a face from one photo (the source) and realistically place it onto a person in another photo (the target). The AI handles the blending, lighting, and angle adjustments to make the swap look as natural as possible."
    },
    {
        question: "Is this face swap online tool free to use?",
        answer: "Yes, our AI face swapper is completely free. You can create as many face swap images as you want without any cost, subscriptions, or watermarks on your final image."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I get the best results with the face swapper?",
        answer: "For the best results, use a clear, high-quality photo where the faces are well-lit and facing forward. The closer the angle and lighting are between the source and target photos, the more realistic the final face swap will be."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I swap faces in a video?",
        answer: "This specific tool is designed for swapping faces in static images. However, we also have a dedicated AI Video Face Swap tool that you can use to perform the same magic on video clips."
    },
    {
        question: "Is it ethical to swap someone's face onto another photo?",
        answer: "This tool should be used responsibly. It's great for creating funny memes with friends or for personal creative projects. Using it to create misleading or malicious content (deepfakes) is unethical and strongly discouraged. Always respect people's privacy and use the tool for positive and creative purposes."
