        question: "What is an AI study notes creator?",
        answer: "An AI study notes creator is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to summarize long pieces of text into concise, easy-to-digest notes. You can paste an article, a chapter from a textbook, or any other content, and the AI will extract the key points and main ideas for you."
    },
    {
        question: "How does the AI notes generator work?",
        answer: "The AI reads and understands the text you provide. It identifies the most important information, concepts, and definitions, and then organizes them into a structured format, such as bullet points or a paragraph summary. This saves you the time and effort of doing it manually."
    },
    {
        question: "Is this AI note taking app free?",
        answer: "Yes, our study notes creator is completely free to use. It's designed to be a helpful resource for students, researchers, and lifelong learners to make their study process more efficient without any cost."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the best way to use the notes summarizer?",
        answer: "The best way to use it is to paste the entire text you need to study. Don't worry about it being too long. The AI is designed to handle large amounts of text. Then, choose the desired length and format for your notes to get a summary that best fits your study style."
    },
    {
        question: "Can the AI take notes from a lecture?",
        answer: "While this tool works with text, you can easily use it for lectures. First, use a transcription service (like our Voice-to-Text Converter) to get a text version of the lecture. Then, paste that transcript into this tool, and the AI will create organized study notes from it."
