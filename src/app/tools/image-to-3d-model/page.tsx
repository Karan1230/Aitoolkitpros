    {
        question: "What is an AI image to 3D model converter?",
        answer: "An AI image to 3D model converter is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to analyze one or more 2D images and construct a three-dimensional model from them. It automates the complex process of 3D modeling, making it accessible to everyone."
    },
    {
        question: "How does the AI 3D model generator from an image work?",
        answer: "The AI analyzes the shapes, shadows, and perspectives in your uploaded image(s) to understand the object's geometry. It then constructs a 3D mesh that represents the object, which you can then view and download. Providing images from multiple angles can improve the accuracy of the final model."
    },
    {
        question: "Is this 2D to 3D model converter AI free?",
        answer: "Yes, our image to 3D model AI tool is completely free to use. It's a great resource for game developers, 3D artists, and hobbyists who want to quickly create 3D assets without expensive software."
    },
    {
        question: "What format is the downloaded 3D model in?",
        answer: "The tool typically exports models in common 3D formats like .OBJ or .GLB, which are compatible with most 3D software, including Blender, Unity, and Unreal Engine, as well as for use in in AR/VR applications."
    },
    {
        question: "What kind of images work best for creating a 3D model?",
        answer: "For best results, use clear, well-lit photos of a single object against a simple background. If possible, upload multiple photos of the object from different angles (front, side, back, top) to give the AI more information to build an accurate model."
