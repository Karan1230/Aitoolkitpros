    },
    {
        question: "How does the AI room designer work?",
        answer: "You simply upload a clear photo of your room, select the room type (e.g., bedroom, living room), and choose a design style (e.g., Modern, Industrial). The AI then analyzes your photo and re-imagines the space according to your selected style, generating a new image of the redesigned room."

    },
    {
        question: "What is the best way to take a photo for the AI home design tool?",
        answer: "For the best results, take a well-lit, clear photo from a corner of the room to capture as much of the space as possible. Ensure the photo is not blurry and shows the main features of the room you want to redesign."
