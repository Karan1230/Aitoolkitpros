  **Key Objectives:**
  1.  **Inject Personality:** Add a touch of personality and a more conversational tone.
  2.  **Improve Flow:** Use varied sentence structures, contractions (if appropriate for the language), and natural transitions.
  3.  **Remove AI Clich√©s:** Eliminate common AI phrases like "In conclusion," "Moreover," "It is important to note," etc.
  4.  **Add Nuance:** Introduce subtle emotional context or a more personal perspective where appropriate.
  5.  **Maintain Core Meaning:** The original meaning and key information of the text must be preserved.

  **Original AI-Generated Text:**
  "${input.text}"

  Rewrite the text to sound as if it were written by a thoughtful, engaging human. Generate only the humanized text as the output.`;
